 * Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
 * 
 * For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to
 * [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
 * 
 * Note: Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3
 * different ways to solve this problem.
 * 
 * [show hint]
 * 
 * Hint: Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space? Credits: Special thanks
 * to @Freezen for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
